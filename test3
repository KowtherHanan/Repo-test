another test to see if we can make a working extra branch lol

“What is your main interest outside of university?”

“I have a strong interest for volunteering, although I haven’t gotten involved in anything yet. I guess I like doing it because it brings me a sense of satisfaction. Before I came here, I did the IB program at high school. We had a course called CAS which stands for ‘Creativity, Activity and Service, for which we had to arrange a charity project - so my group went to Cambodia. There we helped students who lived in poverty and had no other home than their school. We brought them clothes, snacks and even gave them a hygiene class. It was a really fun and enriching trip! I really want to do something similar here at university, I just haven’t found the opportunity yet.”

"I love making coffee because it gave me the independence to go wherever I wanted to go while doing what I enjoy.

I've been making coffee here for three and a half years. It's a beautiful area and it's wonderful getting the chance to talk to so many different and interesting people. Especially all the students; they all appreciate a coffee after a hard day of studying. It's nice to be able to make something that people can enjoy, and even nicer when they show appreciation for it by becoming your regulars. I like to get to know them: I start off with their preferred drink, and then every time they come back I strike up a conversation and try to learn something new. It's wonderful what you can discover."
“I just kind of fell into dance at 14 years old. I used to listen to grime music, which I don’t want to say is the UK’s version of Hip Hop, but it definitely has similarities in terms of the style of music and the feeling it gave me. So I just took a random class one day and noticed I really enjoyed it. Only years later I realised oh, this is Hip Hop, and these are the street dance styles.

When you’re younger, you don’t think, “Am I going to be good or bad”, we create that in our heads as adults. It’s not there when you’re young - you just do it. It’s either, that was good or it wasn’t. And my reaction was that dance felt good, I remember looking around and realising, “I think I’m good at this.” I still recall that.

As adults, we complicate things. And especially because I do dance as a profession, there’s a lot of pressure and preconceived ideas of what it means to be a female in Hip Hop. So when I get a little bit overwhelmed by things or I feel myself overcomplicating things, I try to take it back to ‘where did I start?’ And when I unpack all of that, it’s just because it felt good. So honestly, I try to take it back to that in my classes as much as possible.

I didn’t know it would be my career when I started; it was just for fun. It’s only when I got to university and started studying history. I couldn’t wait to finish the lecture so I could run to rehearsal. You’ve got a check-in with yourself about what makes you feel good, and I chose what made me feel good.”
